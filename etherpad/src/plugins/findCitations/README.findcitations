Use data created by urlIndexer, but now search by URL
instead of by tag -- in other words, given

http://planetmath-laptop:9000/ep/tag/?url=http://foo.bar.com

return a list of the pads that contain http://foo.bar.com
-- simple as that.

Presumably we require that urlIndexer be installed.

But when does it do its work?
