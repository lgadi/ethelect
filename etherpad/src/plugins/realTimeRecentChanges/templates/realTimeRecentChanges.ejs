 /* I'm starting by copying and pasting findCitations.ejs
    here, with the thought that we will once again just
    override a few parts of the tagBrowser.  However,
    that's not the way I want the final version of this
    thing to work: I want a plugin that overrides various
    parts of the tagBrowser WHEREVER THEY ARE USED, so I
    can get real-time updating in all of the search
    plugins.  BUT for a demonstration of the idea, it
    would be nice to at least see real-time search results
    appearing somewhere.  Hence this file as an
    intermediate step.  */
